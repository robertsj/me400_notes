    "## Overview of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a scripting language, which means \n",
    "it is [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)\n",
    "and not [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language).\n",
    "Interpreted languages are converted from human-readable text files to binary \n",
    "(i.e., the 1's and 0's a computer understands) on-the-fly.  That makes the \n",
    "cycle of changing a program, running it, correcting the program for errors, and \n",
    "re-running it much, much faster than with compiled languages.  A compiled \n",
    "language, on the other hand, is converted to binary once-and-for all by an \n",
    "explicit compilation step.  That step makes rapid changes a bit more \n",
    "painstaking to implement.  Learning to program is so much easier without this \n",
    "step, and many of the problems we need to solve don't really require the added \n",
    "computational performance that compiled languages provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several versions of Python are in current use, but the most popular versions \n",
    "are 2.7 and 3.6.  Despite the numbering, both versions are current \n",
    "(but [not forever](https://pythonclock.org/).  In this \n",
    "class, we will work exclusively with Python 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to various versions of Python, there are many distributions of \n",
    "Python.  By distribution, I mean a collection of the Python interpreter (which \n",
    "is what executes the code you write), editors, and/or packages for performing \n",
    "specific tasks.  Here, we'll be using \n",
    "[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/),\n",
    "which provides a very easy way to manage Python and its packages on Windows, \n",
    "Mac OS/X, and Linux machines.  Currently, a full version of Conda is installed \n",
    "on the departmental machines and represent everything you need for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For folks who want to install Python on their own machines, you may install\n",
    "the same [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) package on the MNE machines.\n",
    "Note, the file is pretty large.  Be sure to select the latest version (3.7 as 1/19) appropriate\n",
    "for your operating system."

    "## Accessing Python\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You should see some information about the Python build (which, in this case, uses the version Python 3.5.2).  You will also see the traditional marker `>>>` followed by a (possibly blinking) cursor.  It's here that you can enter single lines of Python code.  Type the following and press enter:\n",

    "```\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular interface to Python is called the [Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html).  An alternative (that we'll also see in Spyder below) is IPython, which can be used by typing \"ipython\" in place of \"python\" in your original CMD window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary way that I would recommend using Python for anything but the smallest tasks is by using Spyder, an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).  Unlike IDLE, which is based entirely in the terminal window, Spyder provides a complete environment that incorporates a text editor (for writing complete Python programs), a variable explorer (we'll see that that means later), and a Python terminal (either IDLE or IPython), among other features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To access Spyder, type \"Spyder\" into the CMD window and press enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Opening Spyder](access_python_4.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "You should see something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spyder interface](access_python_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To the left is the text editor.  To the upper right is a tabbed pane that defaults to a Help menu.  Notice one of the other tabs is \"Variable explorer.\"  Finally, the lower right pane contains the IPython console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to interact with Python is through use of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).  Jupyter allows one to produce documents within a web browser that contain text, images, links, and, of course, Python code.  In fact, these online materials were all produced using the notebook format and converted to the form you are now seeing!  \n",
    "\n",
    "To fire up Jupyter, just type \"jupyter notebook\" in the CMD window and press enter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Starting Jupyter](access_python_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see something like the following:\n",

    "![Jupyter interface](access_python_7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should recognize the listed items: they are the various folders in your home directory.  Now, let's make a new notebook.  First navigate to whichever directory you want to contain the file (here, that's the Documents folder).  Then click the \"New\" icon in the upper right and select \"Python [default]\", as shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "For the rest of this lesson, we'll take a look at the various data types one can use in \n",
    "the Python language.  These types range from the simple `int` and\n",
    "`float` numerical types, to the flexible container types\n",
    "`list`, `tuple`, and `dict`.  Certainly, we'll encounter\n",
    "other types as we go on (and we can even define our own types with classes), but an \n",
    "understanding of these basic types is essential\n",
    "for getting the most out of Python.\n",

    "Python, like every other language I've used, uses [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29), which consist of a *name* to which a *value*\n",
