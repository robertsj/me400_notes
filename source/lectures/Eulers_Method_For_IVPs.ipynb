    "revisit the tools provided by SymPy and apply them to solution of *ordinary differential equations* (ODEs).  Engineering is full of ODEs, since they are fundamental to the language of balance relationships found in heat transfer, nuclear reactor physics, control systems, and other areas.  The goal here is *not* to present the theory of ODEs, nor is it to present the various systematic ways be which one can determine solutions to ODEs.  Rather, the focus is placed squarely on defining ODEs symbolically, solving them symbolically, and, *importantly*, applying initial or boundary conditions to those  symbolic solutions and solving the resulting *algebraic* equations for any undetermined coefficients.  In other words, the focus is on the *problem solving* process.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already have a basic comprehension of ODEs, especially IVPs, at the level covered in MATH 340 (now a pre-requisite for this course).  That includes deducing general solutions, applying initial conditions, and determining complete solutions.  In fact, you should also know something about Laplace transforms and Euler's method, the latter technique which is the focus of this lesson.  Specifically, you should, given a day or two of review, be able to sit down and complete a good chunk of an exam like [this one](https://www.math.ksu.edu/courses/exam-archive/math240/Math240fxS17.pdf) at a passing level.  If that is *not* the case, see an instructor in office hours and/or begin to review the [MATH 340 textbook](https://www.math.ksu.edu/math240/book/).\n",

    "A *differential equation* is any equation in which an unknown function $f$ appears with one of more of its derivatives.  When $f$ is a function of only one variable, the derivatives are *ordinary* (as opposed to *partial*), and the equation is an *ordinary differential equation* (ODE).  In compact notation, such an equation may be written\n",

If $\\mathcal{L}$ contains only *linear combinations* of $f(x)$ and its derivates, then $\\mathcal{L}$ is a *linear operator*, and the equation is a *linear* ODE.  If $q(x) = 0$, the equation is *homogeneous* and is otherwise *inhomogeneous*.  If the highest derivative of $f(x)$ present in $\\mathcal{L}f$ is $n$ (i.e., $d^n f/dx^n$), then the equation is called an *n*th-order equation.\n",

For comparison, a nonlinear example is $\\mathcal{L}f = \\left ( \\frac{df}{dx} \\right )^2 - \\sqrt{f(x)}$, which includes nonlinear functions of $f$ and its first derivative.\n",

    "A first-order IVP can be used to represent of a number of physical phenomena.  The first that comes to mind (to me, as a nuclear engineer) is [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay) with external production, usually written $N' = -\\lambda N(t) + R(t)$, where $N(t)$ is the number of radioactive nuclei at time $t$, $\\lambda$ is the decay constant (with units of inverse seconds), and $R(t)$ is the number of new nuclei born per second.  The time rate of change of $N(t)$ is a balance of those new nuclei from $R(t)$ against the number $-\\lambda N(t)$ lost by decay.  For sufficiently long times, $dy/dt \\to 0$, and $y = R/\\lambda$, a *steady state* in which losses are exactly balanced by gains.\n",

    "An equally good example is the case of an object of mass $m$ in [free fall through a viscuous medium](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/lindrg.html), e.g., the atmosphere.  If some object is held a distance above the earth and dropped, its acceleration at any point in time is related to the net forces acting on the body.  These forces include the gravitational force $F_g = -m g$ (i.e., downward) and the air resistance $F_r$.  A simple resistance model is $F_r = cv$, where $c$ is a (positive) constant and $v$ is the velocity directed toward Earth. Hence,\n",

For the free-fall case, the steady-state condition $v'=0$ has a special name: *terminal velocity*.  \n",

Oh, and I'm not joking about pythons: combine the  [Malthusian model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model) with the fact there is an artificial source term due to pet owners releasing their larger-than-expected pets into the [Florida Everglades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_pythons_in_Florida)."

    "**Exercise**:  Solve $y' + y(t) = 10$ for $y(0) = 0$, $t \\in [0, 10]$, and $N=25$ with the forward-Euler method.  Plot the numerical result along with the analytic solution $y(t) = 10 - 10e^{-t}$. \n",

    "*Solution*: First, rearrange to get $y' = f(y(t), t) = 10 - y(t)$.  The exact solution can be found using the integration-factor technique shown in a solved exercise above.  The rest can then be done in code."

This second-order error in $y_n$ is the *local error*, i.e., the error introduced by a single step in time.  On the other hand, the *global error* is the error shown above as a function of time.

    "\n",
    "However, for fixed $t$, how *fast* does the error decrease with $\\Delta$?  And for fixed $\\Delta$, how does the error change with time?  Let's expand the error $\\varepsilon(t, \\Delta)$ about $\\Delta = 0$:\n",

    "Evidently, the global error is of first order.  However, it's not clear (or easy to determine) exactly how the error depends on $t$ for fixed $\\Delta$.  If we assume $p > 0$ (i.e., radioactive decay and not multiplying pythons), then \n",

For example, the backward-Euler approximation is unconditionally stable, demonstration of which is an exercise left to the student (i.e., repeat this study with backward Euler and show that $\\varepsilon(t, \\Delta)$ cannot blow up)."
