<h2>Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#Algorithms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An <em>algorithm</em> is procedure by which a problem (computational or
otherwise) is solved following a certain set of rules. In many computer
science departments, entire courses are dedicated to the study of
algorithms important for solving a wide variety of problems. Some of the
most important algorithms (including a few that we&#8217;ll be studying in
part throughout the semester) are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Gaussian elimination (for solving <span class="math">\(\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}\)</span>)</li>
<li>Bubble sort (for sorting an array of values)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a> (a better way
to sort those same values)</li>
<li>Sieve of Eratosthenes (for finding prime numbers)</li>
<li>Babylonian method (for finding square roots)</li>
<li>Linear search (for finding a value in an array)</li>
<li>Binary search (a better way for finding that value)</li>
<li>Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm (for finding, e.g., the shortest path between
two cities)</li>
<li>RSA algorithm (for encrypting and decrypting messages)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many more such algorithms are listed
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that we apply algorithms all the time in
every-day life, often without realizing it. Such occasions might be as
boring as choosing one&#8217;s outfit for the day based on planned activities,
the weather, the general status of laundry (and how many times you think
you can wear that pair of jeans), etc. Other occasions of somewhat more
importance might include choosing a baby&#8217;s name (which might mean making
a list, whittling it down, and then convincing your wife that Linus is
<em>the one</em> not just because that&#8217;s the name of the Finnish-born inventor
of Linux). The list goes on and on: life presents problems, and we apply
logic to solve those problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Sequence-by-Example:-Computing-Grades">
<h2>Sequence by Example: Computing Grades<a class="headerlink" href="#Sequence-by-Example:-Computing-Grades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider something with which you are all familiar: a course
grading scheme. As a concrete example, suppose the course in question
has graded tasks in four categories, each with its own weight:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>homework - 20%</li>
<li>laboratories - 10%</li>
<li>quizzes - 10%</li>
<li>examinations - 60%</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a scheme is probably familiar, and you&#8217;ve probably used your
intuition, knowledge of your grades, and knowledge of this sort of
weighting scheme to compute a final percentage. Here, we&#8217;ll formalize
that process using flowcharts and pseudocode.</p>
<p>To simplify matters somewhat (for now), assume that there are a fixed
number of tasks in each category, and each task within a category is
worth the same amount. For example, the course might have 5 homework
assignments, and each of these assignments might be assessed out of ten
points. Take those scores to be 10, 7, 9, 10, and 10.</p>
<p>You might immediately see how the computation of a homework percentage
can be broken into several independent steps. For instance, we can first
compute the homework score. How? Think carefully. If you were using a
calculator, what would you enter? On mine, I can enter <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">10</span></code> followed
by a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code> and then <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">7</span></code> and then another <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code>. After every addition
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></code>, it prints out the running total. In other words, it&#8217;s
automatically storing the running total.</p>
<p>We can be more explicit, though. Before we add any of the scores at all,
we can set the total score to zero, and thereafter, we can add each of
the homework scores to that total in <strong>sequence</strong>. When that&#8217;s done, we
need to compute the total possible score, which is the number of tasks
multiplied by the point value per task. Finally, we need to compute the
percentage earned on these homework assignments, which is equal to the
total homework score divided by the total number of points possible (and
then multiplied by 100).</p>
<p>This entire process can be described using <em>pseudocode</em>, which is any
informal, high-level (few details) language used to describe a program,
algorithm, procedure, or anything else with well-defined steps. There is
no official syntax for pseudocode, but usually it is much closer to
regular English than computer programming languages like Python. Here is
one possible pseudocode representation of the procedure just outlined
for computing the homework score:</p>
<div class="highlight-octave"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s">&#39;&#39;&#39;Algorithm for computing homework percentage&#39;&#39;&#39;</span>

<span class="c"># Provide the homework percentage</span>
<span class="n">Output</span> <span class="n">hw_percent</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Of course, this might seem long-winded, but it is <em>explicit</em>. As long as
the input and output processes are specified (e.g., providing a printout
of grades and asking for a final value to be written on that printout),
this procedure could be given to most reasonable people and executed
without difficulty. For reference, the total homework score (in percent)
that one should get from the individual scores above is 92.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Exercise</strong>: For each line of the pseudocode above, write the value
of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_score</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total_possible</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hw_percent</span></code>. If a
variable does not have a value at a particular line, then say it is
<em>undefined</em>.</div></blockquote>
<p>A flowchart of the same procedure is provided below.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<img alt="Flowchart for Computing Homework Percentage" src="../_images/homework_sequence.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Flowchart for Computing Homework Percentage</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now, revisit the <strong>bolded</strong> word above: <strong>sequence</strong>. This particular
process for computing the homework percentage is a <em>sequence</em>, which is
the simplest of the logical structures used in programming. A <em>sequence</em>
is nothing more than a set of instructions executed one after another.
The number of these instructions and the order in which they are
executed is known from the start, just like our example here (and the
example seen in <a class="reference external" href="ME400_Lecture_2.ipynb">Lesson 2</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Selection">
<h2>Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#Selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The same sort of procedure can be used for all of the grading
categories, and hence, let us assume now that we have available the
final percentages for homework, laboratories, quizzes, and homeworks.
The question now is how to assign a final letter grade based, for
example, on the traditional 90/80/70/60 scheme for A/B/C/D. For this
grading scheme, anything 90% or higher earns an A, anything less than
90% but greater than or equal to 80% earns a B, and so forth.</p>
<p>Of course, this requires that we first compute the final grade, for
which the final percentages and the corresponding category weights are
required. In pseudocode, that process can be done via</p>
<div class="highlight-octave"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s">&#39;&#39;&#39;Algorithm for computing final percentage&#39;&#39;&#39;</span>

<span class="c"># Increment the final percentage by the weighted contribution from each category</span>
<span class="n">Increase</span> <span class="n">final_percent</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="n">hw_percent</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">hw_weight</span>

<span class="c"># Provide the final percentage</span>
<span class="n">Output</span> <span class="n">final_percent</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What we need next is to define the grade, and that&#8217;s where <strong>selection</strong>
enters the game. Selection refers to a structure that allows certain
statements to be executed preferentially based on some <em>condition</em>.
Hence, selection is often implemented using <em>conditional statements</em>. In
English, a basic conditional statement takes the form <em>If some condition
is satisfied, then do something</em>. More complicated statements can be
formed, but all conditional statements can be rewritten using one or
more of these simple statements.</p>
<p>A basic conditional statement can be represented graphically as shown
below.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<img alt="Flowchart fragment for a simple conditional statement" src="../_images/simple_if.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Flowchart fragment for a simple conditional statement</span></p>
</div>
<p>Armed with conditional statements for selection, we can tackle the final
grade. Given the final percentage, we check whether that value is
greater than 90. If so, the grade assigned is an A. If not, we can
further check whether that percentage is greater than or equal to 80 and
less than 90. If so, a B. If not, we check against 70 and then 60 for a
C and D, respectively. If the percentage has not earned a D by the time
we&#8217;ve checked, our poor student&#8217;s grade, of course, is an F.</p>
<p>This procedure, much like those described previously, can be described
compactly in pseudocode:</p>
<div class="highlight-octave"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s">&#39;&#39;&#39;Algorithm to compute the final grade&#39;&#39;&#39;</span>

<h2>Iteration<a class="headerlink" href="#Iteration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose that the homework grades analyzed above are subjected to a
slight policy change: the lowest score is dropped. Such a policy is
pretty common. How do we tackle this problem? It requires that we make a
decision when adding a particular homework score to the total. In
particularly, we skip adding the lowest score.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Exercise</strong>: Think back to the scores (i.e., 10, 7, 9, 10, and 10).
Now, pick out the lowest score and, <em>importantly</em>, write down how
you came to that conclusion. Seriously&#8212;think about what you needed
to do to choose the lowest number and get it down in words.</div></blockquote>
<p>When I first glance at the numbers, I see that there are some 10&#8217;s and
other numbers, and scanning left to right, I pick out 7 as being the
lowest of them. Then, keeping track of 7 (subconsciously, in this case),
I scan the list and confirm that 7 is, in fact, the lowest score. I&#8217;ll
bet you do something similar, but computers don&#8217;t have eyes (or a
subconscience), and we therefore need to define this a bit more
carefully.</p>
<div class="section" id="The-Basic-Idea">
<h3>The Basic Idea<a class="headerlink" href="#The-Basic-Idea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To start, let&#8217;s assume that the individual homework grades are stored in
an array (e.g., a NumPy <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ndarray</span></code>) rather than as separate values.
Call this array <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hw_scores</span></code> so that we use, e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hw_scores[0]</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hw_scores[1]</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hw_1_score</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hw_2_score</span></code>. From this
array, we need to pick out which element represents the score to be
dropped. Therefore, we need language to describe the process of
<em>iterating</em> through the array elements, i.e., <strong>iteration</strong>. In English,
we might say something like &#8220;for each score in the array, do something.&#8221;
More generically, iteration consists of doing that something until some
condition is no longer satisfied, as illustrated in the flowchart
fragment below:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id4">
<img alt="Flowchart fragment for a simple loop" src="../_images/simple_loop.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Flowchart fragment for a simple loop</span></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that this flowchart bears a striking similarity to the one shown
above for the conditional statement. The difference, however, is that
the flow of the program is redirected to <em>before</em> the condition block.
In other words, a repeating <em>loop</em> is produced that is broken only if
the condition is no longer because of changes made inside the &#8220;do
something&#8221; block. The pseudocode fragment for this same loop is</p>
<div class="highlight-octave"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">While</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">condition</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">satisfied</span>
  <span class="n">Do</span> <span class="n">something</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s apply this to a simple but illustrative problem before moving on
to our homework application. Suppose we want to print every value in an
array <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> of length <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code>. A canonical approach to this sort of
problem starts by defining an <em>index</em> or <em>counter</em> variable (often named
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>) that is used to access the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>th element of the array during
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>th time through the loop. After the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>th element has
been used, the counter is increased by one, and the loop begins again.
Once the counter is equal to the number of elements in the array, the
loop is terminated. Here&#8217;s the complete algorithm in pseudocode</p>

<p>For our homework example, the condition is &#8220;have all the scores been

not a given score is lower than the others. The counter-based approach
to iteration developed above can be used to go through each element of
the homework score array, thereby ensuring that all the elements are
considered. We could compare the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code>th grade to every other grade
(implying an iteration within an iteration), but there is a simpler way.
First, we can set the lowest score equal to the first grade (i.e.,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hw_grades[0]</span></code>). Then, we can go through all the other scores and
compare each to the lowest score. If a score is lower than the current
value of lowest score, that score becomes the lowest score. Along the
way, we can also keep track of the index (location) of the lowest score
within the array. Here&#8217;s the idea in pseudocode:</p>

<h2>Practice Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#Practice-Problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Planning out the logic needed to solve problems can be tricky, and most
students require lots of practice. Each of the topics discussed above
will be the focus of the next several lessons as we dive into their
implementation in Python. However, now is the time to start applying the
sequence, selection, and iteration constructs, and listed below are
several great practice problems to help get you started.</p>
<p>Develop an algorithm for each of the following tasks using both
pseudocode and a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.draw.io">flowchart</a>. Note, many of these
tasks represent great practice problems for Python programs, too. Of
course, if you plan out the logic first using the tools employed in this
lesson, the implementation of your solution in Python later on should be
much easier!</p>
