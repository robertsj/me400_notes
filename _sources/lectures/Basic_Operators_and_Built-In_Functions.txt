This fragment of code is an [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html), which is any combination of values, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated, i.e., has a value.  Expressions are distinct from statements.  For example, `a + b` is an expression (defines a value), but `c = a + b` is a statement (in this case, assignment of a value to a variable `c`).\n",

    "Several arithmetic and other operators can be used in one expression, and the order in which they are applied is important to understand.  The basic arithmetic operators are applied using the same rules applied in mathematics: exponentiation is performed before multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction happen last.  For example, consider $2 + 3 \\times 4^2$.  First, $4^2$ is evaluated, leaving $2 + 3\\times 16$.  Then $3\\times 16$ is evaluated, leaving $2 + 48$.  Finally, the addition is evaluated, leaving $50$.  \n",
